# Pacman Bot
This bot was developed as a part of our Artificial Intelligence course project. It uses min-max game tree search with alpha-beta pruning to determine optimal moves for pacman in the maze. Next, we observed that ghosts in pacman don't take all optimal moves due to some randomization. To take advantage of this, expectimax tree search was implemented. Both bots performed very well compared to human performance. However, expectimax was a better performer than alpha-beta pruning in all our experiments.
