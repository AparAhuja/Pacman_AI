# Taxi Routing AI
This project was a part of our artificial intelligence course. Initially the routing bot used vanilla Q-Learning with value iteration to solve the MDP. Next, SARSA and Policy iteration were implemented to improve convergance rates. But for larger grids solving the MDP directly was not possible so, Reinforcement Learning was used to find the optimal path for the taxi.
